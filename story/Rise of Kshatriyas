Whispers of those who brand themselves as Kshatriyas are often heard in the sewers 
of underground these days. For low level scums to die in flocks is not 
unheard of. Some over-enthusiastic punks thiks they are big enough to start their 
own game, foot soldie are the ones they clear out first. Solanki didn't 
think of it much, as there were systems in place to deal with such punks. So when 
his generals started to drop like flies, these so called Kshatriyas steered 
his attention towards them in a most harshest of manner.

The signs were recognized a bit too late by him. In his organization the secrecy 
regarding the identities of his generals was of high priority. His generals 
worked as shadows and ghosts, ever away from the picture. But for them to be so 
easily exposed, this was a work of no small punk.

And he was no punk alright, but a homeless old man. It took all of Solanki's 
ugly bones to track and capture him. How can the feared Kshatriyas consist of 
a person like him? Was he their leader? How many were there? From the day he 
was captured, he had not once opened his mouth.
