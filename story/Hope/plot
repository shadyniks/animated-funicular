Rudra excited about her first mission carries it out with great enthusiasm, until she intentionally kills the man she was supposed to capture. At the same time, she launches an attack on Shiva. Shiva recognizing that she is not acting of her own accord, sacrifices himself to save Rudra from whatever spirit she is being controlled by. On regaining her senses and realizing what she has done, flees the scene in panic.

Rudra now has to find a plausible explanation to what had just transpired, and who was really behind the death of a supreme God.

Rudra discovers that it was actually Vishnu, or rather an imposter impersonating Vishnu, who was the villain. This she discovers from the villain himself just before he is about to kill her. She is rescued by the son of the bandit chief, who until then had pursued her relentlessly and had attempted many failed assassinations, but on learning the truth changes his mind.
