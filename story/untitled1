A book writer / novelist, life goes on smoothly. Abruptly he is faced with a torrent of problems. Unsurmountable odds. Makes a feeble attempt to fight against the odds. Gives up. In his darkest of hour and his lowest of moment, God/writer appears to him. Inspired, he fights with renewed energy and defeats the oppressor.
