A fierce burst of pride swelled up his chest as he saw his ward, Kunthi, appearing 
from behind the folds of the farthest tree, with some thirty odd bandits close on 
her heels, frantic in pursuit and thirsty for her blood. This was her very first 
field assignment and Vaikunth had been dreaming of this day ever since she was 
placed in his hands kicking and crying, like she was challenging the mighty Kumbh 
himself for a duel.
Were bandits not consumed by such blood lust, it would have been apparent to them 
that they were being lured into an ambush. Just few yards ahead, camouflaged in 
between the trees were 6 more compatriots of her, eager to put all those experience 
yielded from years of simulations and mock battles to some real use. At a close 
distance behind them were their gaurdians including him, supervising this assignment 
as a group of silent spectators.
